# Introduction to Python for Data Analysis
A series of tutorial notebooks on getting started with Python for Data Analysis

## Conda Environment

The requirements.yml file can be used to set up a conda environment with the libraries required to run the code in this repository. The file can be used with conda as follows:

`conda env create --file requirements.yml`

This will create an environment called `intro_python_ds_tutorial`. You can use by running the activate command:

`conda activate intro_python_ds_tutorial`

### Interactive examples

Some of the example use the interactive Jupyter Widgets feature of Jupyter notebooks. In order for this to work properly from a conda environment, you may have to run an additional command:
`jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager`
